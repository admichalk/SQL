## 2. Data Science Coding Questions From Real Interviews at Top Tier Companies
This project is a cumulation of 45 SQL questions asked by top tier companies during real interviews. Companies include Twitter, Uber, Amazon, Airbnb, Apple, Bloomberg, Chase, Dell, Forbes, and many more. Tables and questions where created by StrataScratch. Each query written uses different tables.
